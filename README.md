# Pallet-Nolik

## Overview
Nolik is a protocol for delivering digital content for web 3.0.
It allows developers to create applications for formal communication that connect people without any form of censorship or third-party control.
The protocol design is based on the ServiceLess approach, meaning that no services from third parties are needed for users to communicate.

We achieve that by using combination of blockchian and IPFS technologies.
To build a blockchain engine we are going to use Substrate framework with a custom runtime.
Blockchain logic will allow users to create programmable messages rules so they could control on a cryptographic level how they are going to receive messages.
For example, users will be able to create a white list (or black list) of senders which will protect them from spam or irrelevant conversations. Another example would be creating rules like accepting messages within a particular block range or if a particular token is attached to the message, etc.
