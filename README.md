# Pallet n0l1k
A [Substrate](https://substrate.io) FRAME pallet for sending encrypted messages between accounts

## Overview
n0l1k (pronounced as "nolik", from No Leak) is a protocol for delivering digital content for web 3.0.
It is designed to connect people without any form of censorship or third-party control.
That is possible due to a combination of blockchain and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) technologies and a [serviceless](#serviceless) approach.

Pallet logic allows to create rules for programmable messages and embed them to any Substrate-based chain.
With that it is possible to control who to receive messages from on a cryptographic (blockchain) level.
Create white lists (or black lists) of senders which will protect you from spam or unwanted conversations.

## Key Features
The protocol allows to:

* Communicate without servers or service as a third-party
* Start messaging without disclosing identity
* Create unlimited number of addresses (like emails)
* Stay protected from a middleware attack
* Protect messages from unauthorized access with decentralized end-to-end encryption
* Prove that the message was sent at a particular date and time
* Prove that the message was sent from a particular sender and stay protected from a phishing attack
* Prove that the message was sent by a particular sender
* Prove that the message was sent to a particular recipient or recipients
* Prove that the message was not modified
* Attach tokens (like NFTs) to messages
* Use different clients to get access to messages

## ServiceLess
This approach stands for removing third-parties or any form of centralisation.

### Key design principles
* No power of one human over another
* No single point of failure
* No need to trust the application

### The Why
Any human is a free individual that can't be oppressed by other human.
It may not seem that obvious, but centralisation is a also form of oppression.
It concentrates power it someone's hands and leads to several major problems:
> a) Makes people dependent on others who controls their data, assets, their rights;
> b) Creates a single point of failure which can be attacked or blocked;
> c) Ability to lie and misguide people;
The concept of centralisation is broken by design and can't be fixed with other form of centralisation.

A great example of oppressions would be:
> The [block of ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/blog/russia-block/) in Russia;
> The [ban of a twitter account](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension) of president Trump;
> The [drop of Papler](https://time.com/5929888/amazon-parler-aws/) social network; 
> The [ANOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANOM) messaging app;

In oppose to that, blockchain is decentralized and naturally fixes the problems described above.
