# Pallet n0l1k
A [Substrate](https://substrate.io) FRAME pallet for sending encrypted messages between blockchain accounts

## Overview
N0l1k (pronounced as "nolik" from No Leak) is a protocol for delivering digital content for web 3.0.
It is designed to connect people without any form of censorship or third-party control.
That is possible due to a combination of blockchain and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) technologies and a [serviceless](#serviceless) approach.

Pallet logic allows the creation of rules for programmable messages and embeds them to any Substrate-based chain.
With that, it is possible to control who to receive messages from on a cryptographic (blockchain) level.
That can be done due to the ability to create white lists (or black lists) of senders.

## Key Features
The protocol allows to:
* Communicate without servers or service as a third-party
* Start messaging without disclosing the identity
* Create an unlimited number of addresses (like emails)
* Stay protected from a middleware attack
* Protect messages from unauthorized access with a decentralized end-to-end encryption
* Prove that the message was sent at a particular date and time
* Prove that the message was sent from a particular sender and stay protected from a phishing attack
* Prove that the message was sent by a particular sender
* Prove that the message was sent to a particular recipient or recipients
* Prove that the message was not modified
* Attach tokens (like NFTs) to messages
* Use different clients to get access to messages

## ServiceLess
This approach stands for removing third parties or any form of centralization.

### Key design principles
1. No power of one human over another
2. No single point of failure
3. No need to trust the application

### The Why
Any human is a free individual that can't be oppressed by another human.
It may not seem that obvious, but centralization is a also form of oppression.
It concentrates power in someone's hands and leads to several major problems:
* Makes people dependent on others who control their data, assets, their rights;
* Creates a single point of failure which can be attacked or blocked;
* Creates a need to trust and rely on a single source of truth;

The concept of centralization is broken by design.
A great example of that would be:
* The [block of ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/blog/russia-block/) in Russia;
* The [ban of a Twitter account](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension) of Donald Trump;
* The [drop of Papler](https://time.com/5929888/amazon-parler-aws/) social network;

In oppose to that, blockchain is decentralized and naturally fixes the problems described above.
